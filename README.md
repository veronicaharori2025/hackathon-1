📱 TECNO Spark 40 Hackathon: Adaptive Outage Mode
🌟 Project Overview
Adaptive Outage Mode is a smart battery feature designed for regions with unreliable electricity. It automatically adjusts phone settings during power outages to extend battery life, prioritizing critical functions (flashlight, calls, messaging) while limiting non-essential apps.

👉 Key Problem Solved:
Prevents phone battery drain during frequent blackouts (e.g., daily 6PM–10PM outages at Upper Kabete Campus, Kenya).

🚀 Features
✔ Auto-activation: Predicts outages based on historical patterns.
✔ Emergency prioritization: Keeps flashlight, SOS calls, and messaging active.
✔ Customizable: Users can select which apps to restrict.
✔ Low-resource friendly: Optimized for budget phones like the TECNO Spark 40.
